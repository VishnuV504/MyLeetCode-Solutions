instead of checking for 2^n partitions wether it is a palindrome or not i can genrate all
substrings of s and and  i will check wether it is a palindrome or not if yes then i insert into
hashmap which takes n^2*n for generating all substrings and for checking  if a substring palindrome and when making partitions if the string exists in map then it is a palindrome..
