the idea is simple i have to find atmost k and i will subtract atmost k-1 from that then i will get exactly k but there is something  interesting which  is like
if a number is even how much count i have to add that is the question? if we add a new element to a existing subarray how many new subarrays will be generated it is equal to length right?
ex: 1 1 Â  if add element to 2 to that it becomes 1 1 2 how many new subarrays generated
2,12,112  but how many subarray which are odd elements are generated it is equal to
previously how many subarrays generated! because the number is even
if number is odd i-j+1 new odd subarrays will be generated.!
